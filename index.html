        <p> Hello Lils HBD! 
          I hope today treats you super well and you get a lot of fun stuff to do and a lot of birthday wishes. I wanted to wish you a good year ahead! One with stuff you’re super excited about like jjyukkyu and lego and the cool buildings you always like and you get to spend time with people you truly love and support. And cool presents too, so nice having your bday and Christmas close together eh? 😁

          I appreciate all the energy and care you bring into everyone’s days and I like adore how thoughtful and caring you are, and I hope you feel/get the same value you have been giving today and get celebrated for being who you are. I know last year was super tough and I know you have been working a lot and being busy, but I hope you get the well-deserved rest you need soon. Your presence is a lot brighter than you probably realise, you bring in so much light by being yourself . I'm very grapeful that you are in this world. 
          
          To more good moments oui oui 🇫🇷🍷 *clank* 🍷 
           Love,
          🪿
